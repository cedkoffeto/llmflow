`LLMFlow` is an open-source library built on top of [LangChain](https://langchain.com) that brings the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to Machine Learning tasks, combining human expertise with automated models. It provides a scikit-learn-like API to handle DataFrames and other ML tasks, making it easy to inject domain knowledge and human analysis into ML pipelines.

## Key Features
- **Seamless Human + LLM Hybrid Models**: Combine the power of LLMs with human domain expertise for classification, regression, time-series, and more.
- **scikit-learn Inspired API**: Use a familiar interface to build and run models on structured and unstructured data.
- **Built on LangChain**: Leveraging LangChain to work with transformers and other LLMs.
- **Plug and Play with DataFrames**: Directly operate on pandas DataFrames, providing rich data handling capabilities.
- **Customizable and Extendable**: Modify pipelines to fit your custom needs, inject human judgment where itâ€™s crucial.

## Use Cases
- **Classification**: Easily classify text data with the help of human inputs to fine-tune results.
- **Regression**: Predict complex numerical outcomes by leveraging human analysis to interpret trends.
- **Time Series**: Analyze and forecast time series data while leveraging domain expertise to adjust for outliers.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Go beyond simple sentiment scores and refine results based on specific human-driven contexts.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Spot anomalies with the added insight of human domain knowledge.

## Installation
Install LLMFlow with pip:
```bash
pip install llmflow
```

## Getting Started
### 1. Simple Text Classification with Human Guidance
```python

import pandas as pd
from llmflow import TextClassifier

# Sample DataFrame with text data
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'text': ['This product is amazing!', 'I had a terrible experience', 'Not bad, but could be better'],
    'label': [1, 0, 1]
})

# Initialize the classifier with a human-in-the-loop approach

classifier = TextClassifier()

# Train the classifier
classifier.fit(df['text'], df['label'])

# Make predictions with optional human analysis
predictions = classifier.predict(['The service was exceptional!'])
print(predictions)
```

### 2. Time Series Forecasting with Expert Input
```python
import pandas as pd
from llmflow import TimeSeriesForecaster

# Sample DataFrame with time-series data
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'date': pd.date_range('2024-01-01', periods=10, freq='D'),
    'value': [10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 15, 14, 13, 16, 18]
})

# Initialize the forecaster
forecaster = TimeSeriesForecaster()

# Train the forecaster
forecaster.fit(df['date'], df['value'])

# Forecast future values with domain knowledge applied
forecast = forecaster.predict(steps=5)
print(forecast)
```

### **Next Steps**:
1. Set up the initial project structure.
2. Define core API functions for ML tasks.
3. Set up documentation generation using Docusaurus or mkdocs.
4. Start with simple use cases like text classification and anomaly detection.
